# Bank-Account-Management-System-Simple
This is just a simple project for my university while I am learning the JAVA course . It is focused on creating debit, credit and savings account, writing user's details in a permanent .txt file. User can deposit, withdraw and see their information by log in the system.

This project's goal was to create a Banking system where,
1. Bank employees or User can create, 
(i) Debit Account,
(ii) Credit Account and
(iii) Savings Account.
2. While creating user will provide their Name, Date of Birth, Nominee and Opening Balance.
3. After creating account, the user will get their generated ID and PIN for future login.
4. User can login afterwards with their given ID and PIN and (i) deposit or (ii) withdraw as they like within banking limitation.
5. User can also see their current account information by logging in.

This software can run in any OS as it is written in JAVA language.
This project is successfully created by doing intense amount of work. I learnt a lot from this project. Hope to do future work like this.
